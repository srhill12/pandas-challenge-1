# pandas-challenge-1

 This purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate competency in exploring and analyzing data using the Pandas library.

A dataset from a fictional e-commerce company was provided, and it was from this dataset that I used techniques learned from class to Explore the Data, Transform the Data, Confirm my Work, and Summarize and Analyze.

# Sources

Sources and inspiration from my work within this challenge came from power points from Module 4 and Activities from Module 4. Activity from 4.3 Answering_abstract_questions in particular was helpful.

Other sources include resources and links provided by teaching staff from http:pandas.pydata.org were sources of inspiration and guidance.

Xpert Learning Assistant was used to verify certain sorting functions I was not sure of.

The assignment itself was used as a guide to check the correct answers.

My experience in retail was used in my summary of findings.
